Twenty four hours a day, every day of the year, same flat rate quoted on the phone before the truck rolls.

            <p>
              The NYC Towing Service runs a dispatch network that puts a truck closer to you than the national roadside chains ever can. Five dispatch hubs sit inside <Link href="/locations/manhattan" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold underline">Manhattan</Link>, <Link href="/locations/brooklyn" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold underline">Brooklyn</Link>, <Link href="/locations/queens" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold underline">Queens</Link>, the <Link href="/locations/bronx" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold underline">Bronx</Link>, and <Link href="/locations/staten-island" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold underline">Staten Island</Link>, which means the truck heading toward a stranded Subaru on Ocean Parkway is not coming from a dispatcher in Hicksville who just picked the cheapest available subcontractor. The truck is coming from a garage in MetroTech with a driver who already ran that stretch of road twice this week.
            </p>
            <p>
              Coverage spans every call NYC drivers actually make. Light-duty hook-up work for sedans and compact SUVs on narrow one-way blocks in the East Village. Flatbed transport for AWD wagons, Teslas, Rivians, and every low-clearance exotic out of a Tribeca garage. Heavy-duty wreckers for the box trucks and sprinter vans that die in the center lane of the Cross Bronx. The full roadside set: jump starts for batteries that surrendered overnight, tire mounts after a pothole took out a sidewall on the Belt, lockouts in an airport cell-phone lot at two in the morning, gas delivery on the approach to the George Washington Bridge, and winch-outs after a snowstorm packs six inches of slush against the driver-side door.
            </p>
            <p>
              Behind the phone line is a small team of NYC-native dispatchers who know which bridges are stacked up right now, which exits are closed for construction, and which crosstown blocks the sanitation sweepers just rolled through. That routing intelligence is what turns a typical ninety minute national-dispatch arrival window into our twenty to forty minute standard arrival window, and it matters most at two in the morning in the middle of January when the overnight temperature drops below twenty degrees and every marginal battery in the five boroughs quits in the same thirty-minute window.
            </p>
            <p>
              The flat-rate promise runs across every service we run. <Link href="/services/jump-start" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold underline">Jump-start calls</Link> are eighty five dollars whether we arrive at noon on a Sunday in Midtown or at four in the morning on Christmas Day in Throgs Neck. <Link href="/services/flat-tire-change" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold underline">Tire changes</Link> hold the same rate whether the customer is in a Hudson Yards parking deck or on the shoulder of the Whitestone Bridge. Full <Link href="/services/flatbed-towing" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold underline">flatbed moves</Link> run one hundred seventy five dollars base plus per-mile after the first five included miles, which is the actual number that lands on the final receipt, not a teaser that silently grows during the dispatch process. <Link href="/services/lockout-service" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold underline">Lockouts</Link> and <Link href="/services/gas-delivery" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold underline">gas delivery</Link> run the same flat eighty five dollar rate as the rest of the roadside set. We quote the rate on the phone and we hold it.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also handle the opposite end of the market with the same dispatch line. When a box truck dies in the center lane of the Cross Bronx Expressway at rush hour, when a sprinter van gives up on the Queensboro Bridge on-ramp with a cargo load that needs to get somewhere, when a thirty-two foot Class C motorhome limps off the Verrazzano needing a heavy recovery with proper axle ratings — the same dispatch answers the phone and routes the truck with the right capacity. Fleet accounts, body shops, and dealerships run dedicated account numbers with priority dispatch and net-thirty consolidated billing.
            </p>
            <p>
              The core promise is short. Any borough, any hour, any vehicle, any situation short of hazmat. One phone number. The rate you hear on the phone is the rate you pay when the receipt arrives. Nothing extra bolted on after the fact, no NYC surcharge invented when the driver shows up, no mileage mystery, no storage fees for same-day drops. The simplest possible version of what a tow service is supposed to be in a city that makes everything else complicated.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every call into our dispatch line is answered by a live human inside the five boroughs, not by an automated tree that asks you to press buttons for five minutes before connecting you to someone who will not know where Ocean Parkway actually is. The dispatcher confirms your location, the vehicle year make and model, and the service you need inside the first ninety seconds of the conversation. Before you hang up, you already have a truck number, a driver name, a realistic live ETA based on the current state of the surrounding streets, and a flat rate you can sanity-check against the receipt when it arrives in your inbox later.
            </p>
            <p>
              We built the operation around the specific realities of towing in NYC rather than importing a suburban tow playbook that falls apart on the first one-way block. The trucks are sized to the streets they actually have to work on. The drivers are full-time employees who know the neighborhoods instead of gig workers flipping between three different app notifications. The dispatch hubs are located next to the highway and bridge arteries rather than in a cheap industrial park thirty miles out. Every decision at the operational level is made around the question of what actually gets a truck to a stranded driver in twenty minutes in this specific city rather than in the abstract national version of the business.

                  <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                    Dead battery calls are the highest-volume roadside job we run, especially January through March when NYC overnight lows kill every marginal battery in the city. Our driver arrives with a real load tester, tests the battery before jumping so the customer knows whether the problem is the battery itself, a parasitic draw somewhere, or a dying alternator. If the alternator is not charging, a jump gets a car about five miles before it dies again, so we will tell the customer that and recommend a flatbed tow to the shop instead of sending them home with a system that will fail on the next start.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                    January through March, the overnight lows on Riverside Drive, Ocean Parkway, and the Henry Hudson shoulders sit in the teens and turn every marginal battery in the city into a no-start condition by sunrise. We stage jump-capable trucks inside every borough so the closest one is normally inside a mile of the stranded vehicle, not an hour away from Hicksville on Long Island. The stranded commuter with a Tuesday morning meeting at eight does not have time to wait for a truck that needs to cross two bridges before it gets to the call.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                    Our jump-start driver brings a real load tester, not a cheap voltmeter reading a surface charge off a bad battery. If the battery is truly dead past the point of recovery, we can install a replacement group size on the curb, register the new battery to the body control module for BMW, Audi, and Mercedes that require it, and hand the customer the receipt before their morning coffee cools. If the fault is actually the alternator, we say so and flatbed the vehicle to the customer's chosen shop instead of sending them home on borrowed time.

                  <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                    Light-duty towing is the core of what we do every single shift. Sedans, compact SUVs, hatchbacks, the occasional off-duty taxi, the occasional rideshare car that threw a check-engine light at the worst possible time. Anything under roughly ten thousand pounds gross vehicle weight rating falls into this category. We run wheel-lift trucks that handle tight NYC streets, alley garages with six feet eight inches of clearance, and one-way blocks where a full flatbed simply will not fit without blocking a bus lane and drawing the wrong kind of attention from NYPD traffic enforcement.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                    Most NYC breakdowns are light-duty work by volume. The hard part is never the weight of the vehicle. The hard part is getting a truck into a one-way block in the East Village with a UPS van double-parked blocking half the street, or onto the shoulder of the FDR Drive during evening peak traffic without the truck itself becoming the next lane closure. That is the real dispatch challenge and it is why we stage wheel-lift trucks inside every borough instead of running them all out of one Long Island yard.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                    Base hook-up fee is one hundred twenty five dollars plus per-mile after the first five included miles. Drop to the customer mechanic, the customer home, the dealer in Paramus, a shop in Westchester, or a dealer back home in New Jersey, upstate, or Connecticut. The flat rate the customer hears on the phone is the flat rate that lands on the final receipt. No mystery surcharges, no padding for traffic, no upcharge for the fact that the call happened to be at two in the morning on a Sunday.

                    Changing a tire on a narrow NYC shoulder or a dark residential block is the wrong place to be doing it yourself. We come to the customer, chock the vehicle properly, break the lug nuts with a half-inch impact gun instead of bouncing a tiny scissor jack on cracked concrete, and mount the spare safely. If the damage is a nail or a screw in the tread, we can plug or patch the tire on scene so the customer can drive to a proper tire shop on their own schedule. No spare on the rim? We flatbed the vehicle to the nearest shop with the customer tire size in stock.

The Cross Bronx Expressway eastbound near the Sheridan on-ramp, the Belt Parkway approaching Rockaway Boulevard, and the inbound BQE near Atlantic Avenue will shred a sidewall in one hit on the wrong day. The shoulder of a bridge or the outside lane of the Grand Central Parkway at ten at night is absolutely not where you DIY a spare change with an emergency kit from a 2018 Honda.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                    We chock the wheels properly, break the lugs with a 1/2 inch impact gun, and get the customer spare mounted in under fifteen minutes once we are on scene. If the damage is a nail or a screw in the tread, we plug and patch on the spot so the customer can drive to a tire shop on their own schedule. If the damage is a sidewall cut or a shredded carcass, we flatbed the vehicle to the closest tire shop that has the correct size in stock. Same flat roadside rate as a jump, a lockout, or a gas delivery.

                    Lockout calls are our second-most-common roadside job by volume. We use proper automotive lockout tools, which means air wedges and long-reach tools for most vehicles, decoded entry methods for certain luxury cars, and for the rare modern vehicle where the only safe option is to call the dealer for a replacement key, we will tell the customer that honestly before they pay for a service we cannot deliver. We never use slim jims on vehicles with side-impact airbags in the door panel because that is exactly how the airbag module gets fried and the next repair bill at the dealer rolls into four figures.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                    Lockouts in NYC happen in one of three places most nights. The garage at the customer building, usually after a long day when the keys got dropped on the passenger seat. The meter where the customer just parked, usually mid-errand and now unable to open the door. Or the airport cell-phone lot at JFK or LaGuardia, where the customer went to pick someone up and left the keys on the console while the car auto-locked. Midnight at JFK Lot 5 is our most common overnight lockout call. Dispatch routes the closest truck and we confirm which terminal the customer is near before the truck even rolls.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                    We use air wedges and long-reach tools on most cars. No slim jim on any modern vehicle. For keyless-entry models where the only genuinely safe path is the dealer and a new fob, we say so before the customer pays. Typical on-scene time once the truck arrives is five to fifteen minutes. Flat rate, same as every other roadside call, regardless of time of day or borough.

                  <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                    Flatbed towing keeps all four wheels off the ground, which is required for AWD and 4WD vehicles because dragging the drive wheels destroys the transfer case, required for most EVs because the motor is permanently coupled to the drive wheels and generates current when rolled, and the right choice for low-clearance luxury or sports cars where a wheel-lift truck would scrape the underbody on the first driveway ramp. Flatbed is also the correct answer for any long-distance tow, out of state, to an airport, to a specialty shop in upstate New York or Connecticut. We run multiple flatbeds in every borough.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                    Flatbed is the default for anything with all-wheel drive, any modern EV, any low-clearance exotic, and any tow running outside the city limits. It is also the only sane option for the long runs, a call that starts at JFK and ends in East Hampton, a call that starts at LaGuardia and ends in Teterboro for a private charter, a call that starts in the Bronx and ends in Bridgeport when the Whitestone is moving backward. Short of hazmat loads and vehicles too large for a standard bed, flatbed is almost always the right answer.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                    All four wheels come off the ground when the car is on our bed. Tie-downs land on factory recovery points or subframe mount positions only, never on control arms or body panels that are not engineered to take the load. We run low-angle hydraulic beds with wooden ramp extensions for splitter and splitter-lip clearance, so even a lowered Huracán, a slammed S550, or an air-suspension car that refuses to come out of kneel mode clears the ramp lip without scraping paint, carbon, or a front diffuser.

                    Running out of gas in NYC is embarrassing and dangerous in roughly equal measure. The customer usually cannot safely walk to a station from wherever they rolled to a stop, because the nearest station is either on the other side of a divided highway or a mile away past a row of warehouses with no real sidewalk. We deliver gasoline or diesel directly to the vehicle. Standard delivery is two gallons, which is plenty to get the customer to the nearest pump. The flat-rate call-out covers the delivery, the fuel itself is billed at our cost plus a small handling fee, and it works on every bridge, tunnel approach, and highway inside city limits.

                    The range estimate on a half-decent tank lies about twice a month, usually at the worst possible moment. The middle of the George Washington Bridge upper deck at rush hour. The Cross Bronx Expressway shoulder at three in the morning. The Belt Parkway at the Verrazzano merge during summer weekend beach traffic. You cannot safely walk to a gas station from any of those places, you should not try to flag a passing motorist, and you definitely should not try to coast to the next exit on fumes with a row of commercial traffic behind you.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                    We bring two gallons of the right fuel, regular, premium, or diesel, which is plenty to get the customer to the nearest functioning station. The flat-rate call-out covers the delivery itself. The fuel is billed at our direct cost plus a small handling fee, itemized on the receipt. On-scene delivery time is usually under ten minutes once the truck arrives on site.

                    After a collision, the tow itself is only part of the job. We handle scene cleanup with glass sweepers and plastic absorbent for fluid leaks, proper loading of damaged vehicles without adding more drivetrain or frame damage, and direct drop to the body shop the customer prefers or the shop the insurance company specifies. Our drivers document vehicle condition with timestamped photos before loading, at the drop point, and everywhere in between so the chain-of-custody record is complete for the claim. We bill the customer insurance company directly in most cases.

                    Collision scenes in NYC close lanes fast. NYPD and FDNY manage the scene itself, which is as it should be. We handle the vehicle once the scene is cleared. Our accident-recovery drivers arrive with scene cleanup supplies, glass sweepers, plastic absorbent for fluid leaks, cones for traffic control. They load damaged vehicles on flatbed so the frame and drivetrain take no further abuse during transport. They coordinate drop directly with the body shop the customer or the adjuster has already chosen.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                    We document everything with timestamped photos. Condition at pickup, tie-down points used, the final drop at the shop bay. We bill Geico, Progressive, State Farm, Allstate, USAA, Liberty Mutual, Farmers, and every other major carrier directly in most cases. For at-fault moves or cases where coverage is not yet determined, we collect payment at drop and provide an itemized receipt that the customer can submit for reimbursement once the claim is processed.

                    Heavy-duty towing covers vehicles that light-duty trucks simply cannot handle. Box trucks, sprinter vans, large pickups, oversized SUVs, and anything above roughly ten thousand pounds gross vehicle weight rating. We run heavy wreckers with integrated booms, high-capacity winches, and proper axle ratings. This equipment is critical for commercial breakdowns on the BQE, the Cross Bronx Expressway, the Long Island Expressway, and the bridges where a stalled truck in a travel lane creates a major traffic event that ripples across the entire city road network within minutes.

                    When a box truck dies in the center lane of the Cross Bronx Expressway during rush hour, or a sprinter van gives up on the ramp to the Queensboro Bridge with a delivery load that absolutely has to be somewhere, retail tow dispatch does not have the equipment to recover the vehicle. We run heavy wreckers with integrated booms, high-capacity winches, and axle ratings sized for Class 6, 7, and 8 vehicles. These trucks are staged primarily in the Bronx and Brooklyn for the fastest response to the interstate and bridge network where the commercial volume actually is.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                    Commercial drivers get a direct dispatch phone line, consolidated net-thirty billing with monthly statements, and drivers who actually know the height clearances on every major NYC bridge and tunnel. We coordinate with NYC DOT for lane closures when the recovery genuinely needs it, and we keep the logistics team at the customer trucking company informed with live ETA updates and drop confirmation photos so the dispatcher on the other side can plan the driver hours-of-service continuation without guessing.

                    Motorcycles require flatbed transport, a front-wheel chock, and strapping down through the frame or the pegs, never through the handlebars or clip-ons. Our drivers are specifically trained on sport bikes, cruisers, tourers, adventure bikes, and scooters. We carry soft loops for fairings that cannot take hard straps, ratchet straps rated well above the bike weight, and wheel chocks sized appropriately for bikes ranging from one hundred twenty five cubic centimeter scooters all the way up to full-dresser touring rigs. Works for roadside breakdowns, post-crash recovery, and long-distance transport into or out of NYC to a shop, dealer, or storage lot.

                    NYC motorcycle calls peak from April through October, when commuters on the bridges, weekend riders heading to the Palisades or out to Montauk, and delivery riders in Midtown all put the most miles on the road. When something goes wrong, the last thing a rider needs is a wheel-lift operator dragging a bike sideways down the Queensboro Bridge exit ramp because the operator does not actually carry motorcycle-specific equipment.

                  <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                    We run flatbed with a front-wheel chock and ratchet straps going through the frame or the foot pegs. Never through the handlebars or the clip-ons where the straps would damage the cables and the instrument cluster. Soft loops for bikes with fairings that should not see a hard strap point. The service works for sport bikes, cruisers, tourers, adventure bikes, and scooters from one hundred twenty five cubic centimeters all the way up to a full dresser. Transport to the customer shop, dealer, home garage, or long-term storage.

                    Dispatch runs twenty four hours a day, three hundred sixty five days a year. Snowstorms, holidays, three in the morning on a Tuesday, three in the afternoon on Christmas Day, they all run at the same flat rate with the same response and the same drivers who have been running NYC streets for long enough to know where every pothole, every bridge closure, and every active construction zone actually is right now, in real time, without having to look it up.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                    Dispatch never closes. Overnight rates match daytime rates exactly, holiday rates match weekday rates exactly, and snowstorm calls run as long as the roads stay safe enough to operate a heavy truck on. A three in the morning call on New Year's Eve in Bay Ridge gets the same flat rate as a three in the afternoon call on a Tuesday in Midtown Manhattan. No surcharge for being awake. No markup for being up on a holiday.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                    For anything genuinely life-safety — a vehicle stopped in an active travel lane on a highway, smoke from the engine bay, injuries on scene — the right call is nine one one first. NYPD and FDNY have to manage and clear the scene before we can get in. Once the scene is under control and the traveling public is safe, one call to our dispatch line and the truck is moving. We coordinate with the responding unit on scene for safe positioning and load-out.

                  <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                    Dispatch at the Empire State Building, Fifth Avenue and West 34th Street in Midtown Manhattan. Trucks stage here for runs across all of Manhattan from the Battery at the southern tip to Inwood at the northern edge. The Midtown hub sits closest to the Lincoln and Holland Tunnel approaches for west-side calls, and the Queensboro and Williamsburg Bridges for east-side work heading out to Queens and Brooklyn.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                    Manhattan coverage runs from the Battery to Inwood. Financial District and Tribeca at the southern tip, SoHo and the Village through the middle-lower section, Midtown East and Midtown West spanning Thirty Fourth and Forty Second, the Upper East Side and Upper West Side through the Seventies and Eighties, Harlem and Morningside Heights above One Hundred Tenth, and Inwood and Washington Heights all the way up to the George Washington Bridge. Midtown calls are the highest-volume stretch thanks to garage density and the permanent tourist load, but a late-night Upper West Side building lockout or a Chinatown flat tire is routine overnight work on any given shift.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                    Routing is crosstown-aware. The Lincoln and Holland Tunnel approaches eat more than twenty minutes in peak hours, so west-side calls route around those approaches when possible. The FDR Drive runs faster than the West Side Highway most days but becomes brutal at rush hour between Thirty Fourth Street and the RFK Bridge. We stage the Midtown dispatch specifically to handle Queensboro and Williamsburg Bridge spillover for drops heading into Brooklyn or Queens.

                  <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                    MetroTech Center in Downtown Brooklyn, positioned literally steps from the Manhattan Bridge approach and the BQE on-ramp. Fastest staging in the city for calls across Williamsburg, Park Slope, Bay Ridge, Coney Island, and the full sweep of South Brooklyn. Heavy-duty flatbed units live at this hub because Brooklyn sees the highest mix of AWD, EV, and exotic calls alongside standard light-duty work.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                    Brooklyn is the largest borough by population and the toughest routing problem in the city. Downtown Brooklyn, Williamsburg, Greenpoint, and DUMBO see the most volume by far, with tight streets, active construction everywhere, and the constant bridge spillover from Manhattan. Park Slope, Prospect Heights, and Crown Heights run a steady mix of residential battery and lockout work. South Brooklyn — Bay Ridge, Dyker Heights, Sunset Park, Bensonhurst — gets the Verrazzano overflow heading to and from Staten Island. Coney Island, Sheepshead Bay, and the Rockaway-adjacent blocks pick up the summer weekend volume spikes when the beaches are packed.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                    The BQE is almost never the fastest route through Brooklyn. Local streets win more often than most people expect, especially during peak hours. We route around the Prospect Expressway construction zones and the long-standing lane closures along the Gowanus corridor. Atlantic Avenue crosstown remains the most reliable east-west dispatch corridor. For drops heading to Manhattan we split between the Manhattan Bridge and the Brooklyn Bridge based on live conditions at the moment of dispatch.

                    One Court Square in Long Island City, positioned immediately next to the Queensboro Bridge. This hub covers Astoria, Flushing, Jamaica, Forest Hills, and the full stretch of territory out to JFK International and LaGuardia Airport. On-site impound space available for vehicles held overnight pending owner pickup or shop opening.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                    Queens covers the largest geographic footprint of any borough. Long Island City and Astoria in the near west, Flushing in the center-east, Jamaica in the south, Forest Hills and Rego Park in the middle, and the full corridor running out to JFK and LaGuardia plus the Rockaways along the water. Grand Central Parkway and Van Wyck Expressway calls run continuously during peak hours. Overnight, Jamaica and the airport cell-phone lots handle the bulk of our roadside work. LIC has become a small flatbed capital of its own thanks to Tesla and Rivian density in the new waterfront residential buildings.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                    Routing in Queens depends heavily on time of day. The LIE is fast overnight and essentially unusable at peak. The Grand Central runs more consistent if slightly slower. Northern Boulevard, Queens Boulevard, and Woodhaven Boulevard all serve as reliable north-south alternatives when the main highways back up. For JFK and LaGuardia runs we stage trucks specifically sized for clearance inside the airport loop roads, because low-clearance exotics simply do not fit some of the terminal approach ramps.

                    The BankNote Building on Exterior Street, positioned directly next to the Major Deegan Expressway and the Third Avenue Bridge. Handles the entire Bronx footprint from Riverdale in the northwest corner down to Throgs Neck in the southeast corner. Fast access north on the Deegan and east on the Cross Bronx Expressway. Heavy-duty wrecker units stage here specifically for commercial truck recovery anywhere along the Interstate 95 corridor through the borough.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                    The Bronx sits directly on top of the interstate. The Cross Bronx Expressway, the Major Deegan, and the Bruckner Expressway all converge in this borough, which is exactly why we stage our heavy-duty wreckers at the BankNote Building. Riverdale in the northwest corner runs quiet residential work. Fordham and Belmont around the Bronx Zoo and the Botanical Garden pick up steady mid-range call volume. The South Bronx neighborhoods around Hunts Point run heavy commercial volume tied to the food distribution center. Throgs Neck, Pelham Bay, and City Island fill in the eastern edge. The Cross Bronx eastbound between Webster Avenue and the Sheridan Expressway is genuinely our single most-frequent call location across the entire five boroughs.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                    The Cross Bronx is simultaneously the call generator and the routing challenge. For recoveries on the Cross Bronx itself, we dispatch from the closest on-ramp approach and routinely bring a second truck for lane protection and safe staging. Deegan routing shifts substantially by time of day, with northbound slower in afternoons and southbound slower in mornings. For drops heading into Manhattan we run either the Third Avenue Bridge or the Willis Avenue Bridge depending on which direction has live movement at the moment of dispatch.

                    Corporate Park of Staten Island on South Avenue, positioned minutes from the Goethals Bridge and the West Shore Expressway. This hub provides the fastest response across the entire island, from St. George on the north shore all the way to Tottenville at the southern tip, and from Travis on the west shore to Great Kills on the east. Direct access to the Verrazzano Bridge for Brooklyn crossings and the Bayonne Bridge for recoveries heading into New Jersey.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                    Staten Island runs the longest average driving distance of any borough. North-south runs from St. George down to Tottenville can take a full half-hour on a clear day with no traffic. The West Shore Expressway and Hylan Boulevard carry most of the through-traffic. New Dorp, Great Kills, and Eltingville pick up the bulk of our residential roadside call volume. Deer strikes on Hylan and Richmond Road are a real seasonal call pattern, concentrated October through December, almost always after dusk. Verrazzano Bridge backup calls and Goethals Bridge backup calls both route through this hub as well.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                    Staten Island routing is simpler in overall geometry but the distances are genuinely real. A call running from Tottenville up to New Dorp is twenty minutes on its own before any traffic. We stage the Bloomfield hub centrally so no single call runs the entire island in one direction. For Brooklyn drops we take the Verrazzano, for New Jersey drops we take the Goethals or the Bayonne Bridge depending on the specific destination, and for Bronx or Queens drops we route via Brooklyn rather than running through Manhattan traffic.

            Six scenarios that make up the bulk of our daily dispatch across the five boroughs. The first ninety seconds after something goes wrong genuinely matter — get safe, stop compounding the problem, then call. Every playbook below links through to the full DIY tips page and the deep-dive service guide for the call our team will run when you pick up the phone.

              <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                Turn the key and nothing happens at all. Dome light dim, radio cut out, solenoid clicking without engaging the starter. That is a classic battery problem, and in NYC it usually means either a parasitic electrical draw you have been quietly ignoring for weeks, a dying alternator that has been undercharging the battery on every run, or a battery that was original to a 2017 build and simply waited until a nineteen-degree January night to finally give up for good.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                Safety first, always. Pull the key, set the parking brake firmly, and put the hazards on if the vehicle is anywhere near moving traffic. Do not try to push-start a modern vehicle — most automatics and every single EV simply will not respond, and you will roll the car into something expensive you did not budget for this week.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                Call dispatch with your cross-streets, the year make and model of the vehicle, and whether anything electrical still works at all. We route the closest jump-capable truck, confirm the flat rate on the phone, and either get the car running again or — if the real fault turns out to be the alternator — flatbed you to the customer shop of choice before the new battery dies on the first mile out of the curb.

              <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                Keys on the seat, driver door closed, garage door behind you already coming down. It happens in every NYC apartment garage, every airport cell-phone waiting lot, and every Whole Foods parking deck in all five boroughs. The worst possible move at that moment is calling a neighbor with a wire coat hanger and hoping for the best outcome.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                Modern vehicles have side-impact airbags concealed inside the door panel. A slim jim gone wrong in amateur hands fries the airbag module permanently, and the next repair bill sitting at the dealer shop will reliably land in the four-figure range. Do not. Step back from the vehicle, double-check that the key is not somehow still in a pocket or on the roof, and call dispatch.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                When the lockout truck arrives, the driver confirms the year make and model of the vehicle and uses an air wedge plus a long-reach tool. That is the only method that will reliably not crack the weatherstripping or scar the door frame in the process. Most cars pop open in under five minutes once we are on scene, and the flat rate matches every other roadside call.

                Thump-thump-thump coming up through the wheel. The car pulls hard to one side. Steering feels suddenly rubbery and imprecise. You have a flat, and if you happen to be out on the Verrazzano, the Whitestone, the George Washington Bridge, or anywhere along the Cross Bronx Expressway, the shoulder is absolutely not the right place to DIY a tire change alone at night with no spotter.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                Get the car over as far to the right as you can safely manage. Hazards on immediately. If you can get past the guardrail safely to the shoulder beyond, do that. Stay off the phone with the driver-side door open — passing commercial trucks will take that door right off. Inside the vehicle with the seat belt fastened or behind the guardrail are the only two acceptable positions.

              <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                Call dispatch. Tell us exactly which bridge, which direction, and what mile marker or exit you remember passing most recently. We route the closest roadside truck equipped with a full-size impact gun and proper wheel chocks, mount your spare in under fifteen minutes once on-scene, and get you moving again. No usable spare on the rim? We flatbed you to the nearest tire shop stocking your size.

              <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                The fuel light has been on for twenty miles now, you are trying to make it to the next exit, and the engine sputters once then quits completely in the center lane of the Belt Parkway approaching Rockaway Boulevard. Coast to the right shoulder if you possibly can, never the left shoulder. Left shoulder is a trap waiting for a commercial truck to clip your bumper.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                Kill the engine immediately, flip the hazards on, and stay inside the vehicle with your seat belt fastened firmly. Walking along the Belt Parkway, the Cross Bronx Expressway, or the Grand Central Parkway trying to find a distant gas station is a documented way to get struck by a passing vehicle. That gas station that looks close on your phone map is usually a full mile away through an area with no real pedestrian sidewalk.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                Call dispatch with your current direction of travel, the most recent exit you remember passing, and whether your vehicle takes regular, premium, or diesel. Two gallons delivered is enough to get you to the nearest functioning pump. The handling fee and fuel cost both get itemized clearly on the final receipt. The call-out itself is flat-rate, and the truck is normally on scene in under thirty minutes.

                Tapped rear bumper on the BQE merge. Paint swapped in a parking garage in Midtown. Clipped a driver-side mirror on the Bowery. Both vehicles are still running, nobody is hurt, nobody needs medical, but the damage is enough that the insurance carrier will want photos, a claim number, and probably a police report before the adjuster gets involved.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                Move off the active traveled lane if at all possible — shoulder, a bus stop, a side street, anything out of the main flow of moving traffic. Put hazards on immediately, exchange license, insurance, and registration information with the other driver at the scene, and call nine one one for an accident report if any injuries exist or either vehicle is actually disabled. NYPD makes the decision on whether they respond in person. In typical five-borough fender-benders they often do not, and you will need to file the report online within twenty four hours.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                If your vehicle is drivable but you genuinely do not feel safe taking it home on its own power through city traffic, call us. We flatbed the car to the customer body shop of choice, bill the customer insurance carrier directly in most cases, and send the full photo packet for the claim file to the customer email on the same day.

              <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                Woke up the morning after a nor'easter, went out to move the car for alternate-side parking rules, and discovered a two-foot wall of plowed slush packed solid against the driver-side doors. Or you parked the car overnight on a side street and a plow came through at four in the morning, sealing the tires in six inches of packed ice that will not budge under tire rotation alone.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                Do not keep spinning the drive wheels against the ice pack. You will either glaze the ice underneath into a permanent skating rink, burn out the transmission in an automatic, or smoke the clutch plate completely in a manual gearbox. Clear what snow you can with a shovel if you have one, throw cat litter or sand under the drive wheels for traction grip, and try rocking between drive and reverse one time — gently.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                If the gentle rocking does not break the car free, call dispatch. Our winter extraction crews bring proper winches, snatch blocks, chain hooks, and heavy-duty shovels to break the ice seal around the wheel wells. We dig out the wheel wells properly, break the ice seal with the right tools, and either winch the car free from the curb or flatbed it off the block if the vehicle cannot move safely under its own power after the extraction. Seasonal service runs November through March across all five boroughs.

              <p className="mt-3 text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
                Ninety-second phone call. Tell dispatch your cross-streets, the nearest intersection if you are not sure of the exact address, what is wrong with the vehicle, and the year make and model. The dispatcher confirms whether you need light-duty, flatbed, heavy-duty, or roadside service, and quotes a flat rate before the call ends.

              <p className="mt-3 text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
                NYC-native dispatchers pick the closest appropriate truck and route around live traffic conditions. If the BQE northbound is a parking lot, the truck takes the surface streets. If the Williamsburg Bridge is the fastest inbound path, that becomes the route. You get a truck number and a named driver before you hang up the phone.

                The driver confirms the vehicle condition, takes timestamped photos for the record, and walks through the exact procedure before anything at all touches the car. If we are hooking up, the customer sees the tie-down points. If we are working a roadside job, the customer sees the tool or the replacement part before it gets anywhere near the vehicle.

            <p>
              The twenty to forty minute arrival window is not a marketing claim pulled out of thin air. It is a direct function of having trucks physically staged inside every borough at all times. A jump-start call in <Link href="/locations/manhattan" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold underline">Midtown Manhattan</Link> is answered by a truck already inside Thirty Fourth Street, not dispatched from Hicksville. A flatbed going to a Park Slope brownstone comes from MetroTech, not from Mineola out on Long Island. That borough-level staging is also exactly why we hold the arrival window during Cross Bronx rush hour, during Verrazzano backups, and during the Tuesday morning alternate-side sweep.
            </p>
            <p>
              Routing intelligence matters just as much as the truck placement itself. Our dispatchers actively monitor NYC DOT traffic feeds, listen to local traffic radio, and route trucks around active construction zones, film shoots, and the occasional United Nations General Assembly week that turns Midtown into a gridlock puzzle. If the Lincoln Tunnel outbound is a half-hour wait, we send the Holland Tunnel instead. If both tunnels are jammed, we route via the GWB. The entire call from the customer picking up the phone to the truck arriving on-scene is usually three routing decisions made inside a ninety-second window.

            <p>
              National roadside networks all run a hidden subcontractor model. They quote a rate on the phone, then hand the job off silently to whoever will physically run it cheapest. That subcontractor arrives ninety minutes later in a truck that may or may not be right for the customer vehicle. You end up paying either through a premium membership that covers the markup or through the subcontractor rate itself. We are often the local operator those networks are supposed to call, which means going direct to us usually costs twenty to forty percent less than running the exact same call through a national dispatcher with a markup in the middle.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hourly billing is the other common trap in NYC tow service. Some local operators quote a cheap-sounding hourly rate on the phone, then the clock starts the exact moment the truck rolls out of the yard and does not stop until the customer is unloaded at the destination. A quick thirty-minute hook-up in Midtown turns into a four hundred dollar invoice because the driver claimed traffic ate forty five minutes somewhere. We do not run that playbook at all. A <Link href="/services/light-duty-towing" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold underline">light-duty hook-up</Link> is a flat one hundred twenty five dollars base plus per-mile after the first five included miles. A <Link href="/services/flatbed-towing" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold underline">flatbed move</Link> is one hundred seventy five dollars base plus per-mile after five. Roadside service is eighty five dollars flat, period.
            </p>
            <p>
              What is included in every call: base hook-up, first five miles of transport, up to thirty minutes of reasonable on-scene work, loaded transport to the destination the customer specified, and an emailed receipt. What affects the final price: total distance past the first five included miles, any bridge or tunnel tolls on genuine long-distance runs (passed through at E-ZPass cost with no markup added), and upgrade from light-duty to flatbed if the vehicle turns out to require flatbed (AWD that was misreported as FWD on the phone, or low-clearance sports car that was misreported as a standard sedan — in either case we re-quote the new rate before proceeding). Heavy-duty recoveries and rotator recoveries are priced per individual job based on the capacity required and the time involved.
            </p>
            <p>
              The simplest way to know the final number is to just call. Dispatch quotes the rate before the truck moves from the yard. If the job changes once we are physically on-scene — a hidden damage condition, a vehicle that turns out to need flatbed instead of light-duty service, a winch pull that turned out to be heavier than described on the phone — we re-quote the new rate and you decide whether to proceed or stop. Nothing gets silently bolted onto the invoice after the fact. No mystery surcharges, no teaser rates, no padding.
            </p>

          </h2>
          <p className="mx-auto mt-4 max-w-3xl text-center text-base text-slate-600">
            The right truck for a given job is the difference between a ten-minute hook-up and a ruined drivetrain at the drop point. We run a mixed fleet on purpose — wheel-lift trucks sized for the tight NYC streets, flatbeds for <Link href="/services/flatbed-towing" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold underline">AWD and EV work</Link>, heavy-duty wreckers for the commercial vehicles that break down on the <Link href="/services/heavy-duty-towing" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold underline">Cross Bronx and the Deegan</Link>, and a rotator unit for the occasional multi-truck recovery that a standard wrecker simply cannot handle alone.

              <p className="mt-3 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
                Wheel-lift trucks specifically sized for the overwhelming majority of NYC light-duty work. Sedans, compact SUVs, hatchbacks, and small crossovers. Narrow enough to physically fit into an East Village alley, nimble enough to work a one-way block with no real shoulder to stage on. This is the standard unit for any non-AWD, non-EV, non-exotic call, and it is the unit behind the flat one hundred twenty five dollar base hook-up rate plus per-mile after the first five included miles.

                Low-angle hydraulic flatbeds with wooden ramp extensions specifically for low-clearance vehicles. Exotics, lowered sedans, splitter-equipped sports cars. The default unit for any AWD or four-wheel-drive vehicle, for any modern EV including Tesla, Rivian, Lucid, Mustang Mach-E, Ford Lightning, Hyundai Ioniq 5, and Kia EV6, and for any tow genuinely over twenty miles to the suburbs, airports, or out-of-state destinations.

                Integrated booms, high-capacity winches, full Class 6, 7, and 8 axle ratings. Built specifically for box trucks, sprinter vans, large pickups, RVs, motorhomes, and anything above roughly ten thousand pounds gross vehicle weight. Staged in the Bronx and in Brooklyn for the fastest possible response to Cross Bronx, Deegan, BQE, LIE, and bridge recoveries. DOT-compliant documentation and chain-of-custody paperwork come standard with every commercial tow from this fleet.

              <p className="mt-3 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
                For the multi-truck recoveries that a standard wrecker cannot safely handle alone. Overturned vehicles on the Deegan. Load recoveries where the cargo has to come off before the vehicle can be uprighted. Complex extractions from embankments and ditches. Rotators can set up completely off the side of the active roadway and pick an entire tractor upright without adding further damage to the unit being recovered. Deployed with engineer and safety crew. Rare but absolutely critical when a call genuinely demands it, typically one to two runs per calendar month.

          <div className="mx-auto mt-10 max-w-3xl space-y-5 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
            <p>
              Every truck in the fleet carries the same baseline kit. Proper wheel chocks sized for the load. Ratchet straps rated well above the vehicle weight. Corner protectors for body panel protection during strap pulls. A one-half inch impact gun for lug nuts. An air wedge kit for lockouts. Jump packs rated for large diesel engines. A real battery load tester, not a cheap voltmeter. A fuel transfer can for gas deliveries. Every driver on the road also carries a scan tool for battery registration on BMW, Audi, Mercedes, and any modern Ford or GM vehicle that requires it. Every truck is radio-dispatched and GPS-tracked from the central hub in real time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Drivers rotate across the fleet but specialize in the areas that truly matter. Exotic and luxury transport is handled by cleared drivers with elevated cargo insurance coverage on the unit. Heavy-duty commercial work runs with drivers holding the proper CDL endorsements and DOT hours-of-service compliance. EV transport is handled specifically by drivers trained on Tesla, Rivian, and Lucid procedures including wheel skate deployment for unresponsive vehicles. On-hook cargo insurance covers every truck and every load up to the full vehicle value. COI naming the customer as additional insured is available within twenty four hours for any fleet or property-manager account that requests it.

              What the reviews all have in common is not an accident. It is a consistent pattern of NYC tow work done the way the work is actually supposed to be done. A battery quits in front of a Midtown building at two in the morning, the driver tests the alternator too, notices the battery is seven years past its original date code, and swaps a fresh battery on the spot before leaving. A Subaru needs to go to a New Jersey dealer for service, dispatch sends a flatbed without the customer even having to ask, because AWD means flatbed every single time. A car gets towed from a private lot, we handle the pound paperwork and the release and the final drop, and the customer gets their day back.
            </p>
            <p>
              We hold a strong rating across hundreds of individual reviews because our drivers actually show up in the originally quoted time window, charge the rate that was quoted on the phone, and treat the customer vehicle like it belongs to someone who cares about keeping it in good condition. When something does go wrong on a run, we cover it without an argument. That accountability is exactly why roughly forty percent of our <Link href="/services/flatbed-towing" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold underline">flatbed</Link>, <Link href="/services/jump-start" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold underline">jump-start</Link>, and <Link href="/services/accident-recovery" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold underline">collision recovery work</Link> is repeat customers and direct word-of-mouth referrals from existing customers. NYC runs on word of mouth in this business and our word is honestly the only real thing we have to sell.

              <p className="mt-3 text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
                No different rates per borough at all. The rate the customer hears on the phone is the rate that lands on the final receipt, whether the truck is rolling out from the Empire State Building dispatch hub in Midtown or the Corporate Park dispatch hub on Staten Island. Flat-rate means flat-rate, period. Eighty five for roadside, one hundred twenty five for light-duty, one hundred seventy five for flatbed. What can change is mileage past the first five included miles, which runs four dollars per mile light-duty and five dollars per mile flatbed. Dispatch quotes the total before the truck leaves the yard so there are no surprises later.

                No weekend surcharge, no overnight surcharge, no holiday surcharge on any of our calls. A Tuesday two in the afternoon call in Midtown Manhattan and a Sunday three in the morning call on the Belt Parkway run identical flat rates. The only thing that moves the final price is the actual work itself. A flatbed costs more than a light-duty hook-up. Long mileage costs more than a short drop. A heavy-duty call costs more than either of the other two because the truck is bigger and the insurance premium on that unit is genuinely higher. Holidays and overnight operations are simply included in our normal dispatch schedule.

                We are very often the local operator national roadside dispatch is supposed to call on a given run. Many customers actually find us directly after their national service quoted them ninety minutes and we can arrive in twenty instead. For accident and collision tows we bill the major carriers — Geico, Progressive, State Farm, Allstate, Liberty Mutual, USAA, Farmers — directly in the overwhelming majority of cases. For AAA and other similar roadside benefit programs, check the specific plan reimbursement terms. Most programs cover out-of-network tows with a properly submitted receipt.

The driver arrives with a card reader wired directly into our dispatch system, so the final receipt is emailed before the truck even pulls away from the curb. We do not accept personal checks from first-time customers as a policy. For fleet and dealer accounts, payment terms get set up once at initial account activation and then every subsequent call is billed directly to that account with no physical card swipe at all.

                NYPD-initiated tows all go to one of three main pounds. The Brooklyn Navy Yard pound handles Brooklyn and Queens. The College Point pound handles eastern Queens. The Pier 76 pound on the West Side handles Manhattan and the Bronx. NYC 311 can confirm the specific pound location if you give them your license plate number. Release fees start around one hundred eighty five dollars plus daily storage accumulation, any outstanding parking ticket payments owed, and whatever violation actually brought the tow in the first place. Our impound recovery service handles the paperwork and the physical retrieval for a flat fee plus the pound itemized costs.

                Yes, and we itemize them clearly on the final receipt every single time. A tow from Staten Island to a shop in Bergen County picks up the Goethals or the Bayonne toll. A tow from Manhattan out to LaGuardia Airport picks up the RFK or the Queens-Midtown Tunnel toll. On long-distance runs to Boston, Philadelphia, or DC we use E-ZPass and simply pass the exact toll cost through to the customer with absolutely no markup applied on top. For most same-borough tows and a majority of cross-borough runs inside city limits, no tolls apply at all and the original flat rate covers everything.

                Yes, and only on flatbed. Every major EV — Tesla Model S, Model 3, Model X, Model Y, Cybertruck, Rivian R1T and R1S, Lucid Air, Ford Lightning, Mustang Mach-E, Hyundai Ioniq 5, Kia EV6 — requires all four wheels off the ground during transport. Towing on dollies or with a wheel-lift truck forces the drive motor to generate current, which then cooks the inverter and controller unit permanently. Our EV transport protocol runs flatbed with soft tie-downs anchored at subframe points, wheel skates deployed if the vehicle is unresponsive to commands, and zero contact with the battery tray underneath. Tesla roadside insurance claims get handled directly between us and Tesla.

                Yes. Motorcycle transport runs on flatbed with a front-wheel chock and strapping through the frame, the foot pegs, or soft loops for faired bikes. Never through the handlebars or the clip-ons where the straps would damage cables and the instrument cluster. We have drivers specifically trained on sport bikes, cruisers, tourers, adventure bikes, and scooters ranging from one hundred twenty five cubic centimeters up through full dressers. Transport runs to shops, dealers, customer homes, or long-distance runs to another state are all standard work. Peak season April through October but motorcycle dispatch operates year-round.

                Exotic transport runs on our low-angle hydraulic flatbeds equipped with wooden ramp extensions so a three-inch ground clearance on a low car does not scrape the front splitter on the ramp lip during loading. Tie-downs anchor to factory tow hooks or subframe points only. Drivers cleared specifically for exotic work carry elevated cargo insurance on the unit. Pickup and delivery are handled with full discretion — we are used to moving vehicles out of valet garages in Tribeca, Hamptons estate driveways, and concours d'elegance events held up in Greenwich. Book ahead whenever possible for dedicated crew assignment.

                For the driver who got blocked in physically or is the victim of another car's bad parking decision, we can help get you out once the blocker moves their vehicle. For property managers, landlords, HOA boards, and commercial lot owners, we run a full NYC-compliant private-property tow operation — proper posted signage, photo documentation of every violation, a clearly posted tow-fee schedule, and legal impound handling afterward. We never tow vehicles from public streets without explicit NYPD authorization. Private lots, fire lanes on private property, and tenant-only parking spots are all fair game with the proper setup in place.

                Yes. Trailer breakdowns happen in very predictable ways — bearings seize on the Belt Parkway, tires blow on the LIE, couplers fail at a marina launch ramp, brakes lock up suddenly. We recover boat trailers, jet ski trailers, landscaping and utility trailers, enclosed cargo trailers, and car-hauler trailers. If the boat is physically on the trailer at time of recovery, we dispatch heavy-duty. For light trailer work we can swap a wheel on scene, tow the trailer with its tongue coupled to our truck, or flatbed the entire rig. Seasonal volume peaks late spring through early fall for marine equipment.

                Yes on all three. NYC DCWP tow license on active record, commercial auto insurance coverage, garage liability coverage, and on-hook cargo insurance covering every truck and every load we move. For commercial clients we provide a COI within twenty four hours of any request, naming the client company as additional insured on the policy. Heavy-duty operations comply with DOT documentation requirements, driver hours-of-service rules, and — where applicable to a given job — NYC DOT private-property tow rules. We do not move hazmat under any circumstances. For that the shipper needs a separately licensed hazmat recovery operator.

                If a tie-down happens to mark a bumper, a ramp lip catches a splitter on a low car, or an alley mirror takes a scuff on a tight Brooklyn block, we cover the damage. Our drivers document the vehicle condition with timestamped photos before loading and again at the drop point, so both sides have a complete record. On-hook cargo insurance handles damage claims from the truck side, and we move quickly to settle with the customer rather than stretch a claim out for months through an adjuster. That level of accountability is part of why roughly forty percent of our work is repeat customers and direct referrals.

                The flat-rate pricing itself is the minimum. Eighty five dollars for roadside service — jump, tire, lockout, gas delivery. One hundred twenty five dollars for light-duty towing as a base hook-up fee. One hundred seventy five dollars for flatbed towing as a base hook-up fee. There is no separate trip fee, no fuel surcharge, and no service charge tacked onto the final receipt. If we arrive and discover the vehicle cannot safely be handled as originally quoted — say, a car described on the phone as a sedan turns out to be AWD and genuinely requires flatbed instead of light-duty — we quote the new rate before doing anything and the customer decides whether to proceed or cancel.

                Yes. Many customers schedule flatbeds for dealership drops, auction pickups, classic car moves into storage, or full relocations out of state. Book via the booking page with your preferred pickup time window, the origin address, the destination, and the vehicle details up front. Our dispatcher confirms the assigned driver and the flat rate the evening before the scheduled pickup. Scheduled work gets the same flat-rate pricing and the same twenty to forty minute on-time discipline as emergency dispatch — the customer just gets it at a time of choosing instead of an unplanned emergency.

                There is no earliest hour and no latest hour. Dispatch operates twenty four hours a day, three hundred sixty five days a year including Christmas Eve, New Year's Eve, the Fourth of July, every single blizzard, and the occasional heat wave that makes car batteries quit by two in the afternoon. Overnight rates match daytime rates exactly. Holiday rates match weekday rates exactly. We scale operations up for major snowstorms when the roads are safe enough to run heavy trucks on, and we scale down during major weather events like hurricanes where NYC orders vehicles off the roads entirely — but dispatch itself stays open throughout.

                Hazmat vehicles are a hard no. Vehicles involved in active crime scenes before NYPD clears them — also a no, because that is law enforcement work. Vehicles that have caught fire while still hot require specialized responders and proper cooldown before anyone can touch them. We also decline to tow vehicles where the customer simply cannot establish ownership with a registered owner, a titled buyer, or written authorization from one of those two parties. Other than those specific narrow cases, any passenger vehicle, motorcycle, light commercial truck, trailer, or recreational vehicle across the five boroughs is fair game for dispatch.
