          <h2 className="text-center text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 font-heading">Why Partner With Us</h2>
          <p className="mx-auto mt-4 max-w-2xl text-center text-base text-slate-600">Our operation covers <Link href="/locations" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">all five NYC boroughs</Link> with a growing commercial book of business. Partner operators plug in to <Link href="/services" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">our full service stack</Link> without having to build dispatch, branding, or fleet sales infrastructure from scratch.</p>
          <div className="mt-8 space-y-5 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
            <p>NYC has a long tail of independent tow operators — solo drivers with one or two trucks, small family shops, and owner-operators who run good equipment but don&apos;t have the scale or administrative capacity to compete on commercial accounts. Our partnership model lets those operators plug into a larger operation without losing their independence.</p>
            <p>What you get: lead flow from our dispatch, commercial and fleet account access (DSPs, rideshare, body shops, property managers), brand recognition and marketing, COIs and insurance administration on accounts, and AP/billing infrastructure. What you keep: your trucks, your drivers, your schedule, and operational control of your business.</p>
            <p>Revenue split is negotiated based on what you bring — trucks, drivers, territory coverage, and account access. For operators who want to scale into a full franchise model with exclusive territory, we also support that path for the right partners.</p>

          <div className="mt-8 space-y-5 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
            <p>Our best partners share a few traits: NYC DCWP licensed, insured to current standards (commercial auto, garage liability, on-hook), running clean equipment, and committed to flat-rate pricing and honest service. Prior tow experience is required — this isn&apos;t an entry-level program.</p>
            <p>If you run a solo operation, a small family shop, or an owner-operator business with 1–5 trucks, we want to talk. Same if you run heavy-duty equipment or specialty (EV, luxury transport, enclosed long-haul). Bring what you have. We&apos;ll figure out the right fit.</p>
            <p>For operators interested in full franchise / exclusive territory rights, we support that path for the right partners — longer-term commitment, revenue model, and territory protection are negotiated individually.</p>
