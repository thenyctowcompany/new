    `Need ${c.svcLower} in ${c.city}? The NYC Towing Service runs this exact job 24 hours a day, with trucks staged in ${c.state} and typical arrival times of 20–40 minutes. Pricing is flat-rate and quoted before we dispatch. There is no NYC surcharge layered in afterward, no "storage fee" that appears when you arrive at the drop, and no after-hours markup on overnight or weekend calls. If your situation in ${c.city} calls for ${c.svcLower}, dispatch the right truck once — from a licensed local operator who actually lives in ${c.state} and knows the streets.`,
  (c: Ctx) =>
    `${c.svcTitle} in ${c.city} is one of the calls our ${c.state} dispatch desk runs every single day. We staged trucks here because volume demands it — drivers who live and work in the borough know which blocks are one-way the wrong direction right now, which garages have clearances too low for a standard wheel-lift, which intersections always back up on rush hour, and which enforcement agents are actively ticketing. That local knowledge turns a 90-minute out-of-area tow into a 30-minute local job. Flat-rate pricing, 24/7 dispatch, no subcontractor chain.`,
  (c: Ctx) =>
    `If you are stranded in ${c.city} and the word you just typed into your phone was "${c.svcLower}," you landed on the right page. We are The NYC Towing Service — licensed by NYC DCWP, running trucks staged across ${c.state}, dispatching 24 hours every day of the year including holidays. Flat-rate quotes on the phone before we dispatch. Typical arrival 20–40 minutes. Licensed, insured, W-2 employees — not gig workers routed through a call center in another state.`,
];

const INTRO_P2 = [
  (c: Ctx) => c.service.longDescription,
  (c: Ctx) =>
    `${c.service.longDescription} That description is the baseline — every ${c.svcLower} call adds context that changes exactly how we execute. A ${c.svcLower} call in a narrow ${c.city} side street requires different positioning than the same call on an open parkway shoulder. A call on a luxury or low-clearance vehicle requires different equipment than a call on a standard sedan. Dispatch sorts that on the phone so the right crew and rig show up the first time.`,
  (c: Ctx) =>
    `Here is how we describe ${c.svcLower} to drivers who have never needed it before: ${c.service.longDescription} For ${c.city} specifically, the variations that matter are vehicle type (AWD, EV, luxury, commercial, motorcycle all change our procedure), access constraints (narrow streets, low-clearance garages, active bike lanes, construction), and destination (a local shop, a dealer, a body shop, a residence, an out-of-borough specialty mechanic).`,
];

const INTRO_P3 = [
  (c: Ctx) =>
    `Our ${c.city} drivers handle ${c.svcLower} calls daily. They know the local streets, parking rules, building clearances, and common hazards — streetcar tracks where they exist, bike-lane concrete curbs, low-clearance residential garages, and the specific intersections where police enforcement or active construction can complicate a hookup. That local knowledge is why we arrive fast and get the job done without the "we cannot access it" callback that plagues out-of-area operators.`,
  (c: Ctx) =>
    `Drivers assigned to ${c.city} know the shape of the neighborhood. They have been to the commercial blocks, the residential side streets, and the main corridors enough times to route around trouble without a map. They know which addresses only have ${c.abbr} side access, which buildings have rear loading docks, where the overnight no-standing zones flip, and which cross-streets always back up at 4 PM. That familiarity compresses every call by 10–20 minutes compared to a generalist dispatched from a remote call center.`,
  (c: Ctx) =>
    `${c.city} geography matters a lot on a ${c.svcLower} call. A block that is one-way the wrong direction can turn a 10-minute tow into a 40-minute tow. A garage with 7-foot clearance can make the difference between a wheel-lift job and a flatbed job. A bike lane or dedicated bus lane on the block means different positioning for the truck. Our ${c.state} team has run enough calls across ${c.city} that the local micro-decisions are automatic — not something we figure out on scene.`,
];

const INTRO_P4 = [
  (c: Ctx) =>
    `For ${c.svcLower} specifically in ${c.city}, we carry the right tools on every truck. Proper battery testers (a load tester that actually stresses the battery, not just a voltmeter), full-size impact guns and NY-sized lug sockets for tire changes, air wedges and long-reach tools for lockouts, fuel cans rated for on-road delivery, and tie-down kits sized to every vehicle class we might encounter. Whatever the call, the gear is already in the truck — we are not leaving to pick something up.`,
  (c: Ctx) =>
    `Every truck we dispatch into ${c.city} for ${c.svcLower} is pre-stocked with the exact equipment the job commonly requires. We do not roll out to a call and improvise. The kit includes the primary tool for ${c.svcLower} plus the backup tools for the secondary situations that turn up on one call in five. Experienced drivers know the phoned-in description does not always match what they find on scene. The truck is ready for both.`,
  (c: Ctx) =>
    `One thing that separates licensed operators from light-pole flyer outfits: the truck has the right equipment on board before it leaves the yard. For ${c.svcLower} in ${c.city}, that means the primary gear, the secondary gear, NYC-specific extras (wheel chocks that hold on Manhattan and Bronx hills, work lights for overnight shoulder calls, absorbent for fluid spills on residential streets), and full documentation kit (phone mount, dash camera, digital intake pad). Arrive prepared, finish fast.`,
];

const HOW_P1 = [
  (c: Ctx) =>
    `Step 1 — Call ${PHONE}. Tell dispatch you are in ${c.city} and you need ${c.svcLower}. Share the cross-streets (or nearest intersection if you do not know the address), the vehicle year/make/model, and any details that matter — AWD, EV, low clearance, keys are in the ignition, what warning lights are on the dash, whether the vehicle is driveable at all. The call takes about 90 seconds. No phone tree, no "press 1 for dispatch," no transfer to a subcontractor.`,
  (c: Ctx) =>
    `Step 1 is a single phone call to ${PHONE}. A live NYC dispatcher answers — not a call center in another state, not a chatbot, not a voicemail. Tell them you are in ${c.city}, the service you need (${c.svcLower}), the vehicle, and the nearest cross-streets. If you cannot see a street sign, the dispatcher can locate you off your phone GPS. 90-second call on average. You hang up with a truck number, a driver name, and an ETA.`,
  (c: Ctx) =>
    `The first step is the phone call: ${PHONE}. That number is answered in NYC by someone who knows ${c.city}. Tell the dispatcher which cross-streets you are near, whether you are on a side street or on a main corridor, the vehicle (year / make / model), and what symptom or damage you are seeing. Extra details like "battery tested okay yesterday" or "the car was fine until I hit that pothole on the BQE" help dispatch pick the right truck and crew.`,
];

const HOW_P2 = [
  (c: Ctx) =>
    `Step 2 — You get a flat-rate quote and a live ETA before the call ends. The dispatcher is NYC-based, so the ETA is honest. If traffic is bad in ${c.city} right now, if there is a truck queued ahead of yours, if weather is pushing times out — you hear that on the call. We send you a truck number and driver name so you know who is showing up. For tows, you also get the destination confirmed (your shop, your dealer, your house) so there is no mid-run surprise.`,
  (c: Ctx) =>
    `Step 2 happens before the call ends: the dispatcher quotes a flat rate and a live ETA for your ${c.svcLower} job in ${c.city}. Flat rate means the number you hear on the phone is the number on the invoice, unless the scope materially changes. If the dispatcher thinks the job might shift (a jump-start could become a tow because the alternator sounds dead), they will say so and quote both outcomes before dispatching. The ETA is based on which truck is nearest and what the current traffic looks like — not a generic "30 to 60 minutes."`,
  (c: Ctx) =>
    `Immediately after the phone call intake, dispatch quotes a flat rate and an ETA. For ${c.svcLower} in ${c.city}, rates follow our standard model (light-duty tow $125 base, flatbed $175 base, roadside $85 flat, heavy-duty quoted per job). The ETA is live — whatever the dispatcher says on the phone is the real number. If a truck cannot actually make it in 30 minutes because of ${c.city} rush-hour traffic, dispatch tells you 50 minutes instead of bait-and-switching you.`,
];

const HOW_P3 = [
  (c: Ctx) =>
    `Step 3 — Driver arrives at your ${c.city} location, confirms the vehicle condition with you in person, takes timestamped photos (for your records and for ours), and walks through the procedure before touching anything. For tows in ${c.city}, you see the tie-downs or hookup points before the vehicle moves. For roadside, you see the exact tool or part before it touches the vehicle. Nothing happens out of sight, and nothing happens without you understanding what is about to happen.`,
  (c: Ctx) =>
    `Step 3 is the arrival on scene in ${c.city}. Our driver rolls up in a marked truck matching the number dispatch gave you, confirms vehicle identification with you (plate, VIN, year/make/model), takes condition photos with a timestamp, and walks through the ${c.svcLower} procedure out loud. Photos protect both of us: if something was already damaged before we got there, we have proof; if we caused any incidental mark during the hookup, we have proof too. The photo walkthrough takes 60 seconds.`,
  (c: Ctx) =>
    `When our truck arrives at your ${c.city} location, the driver does three things before touching your vehicle: confirms it is the correct vehicle (plate, VIN, make/model), photographs the condition (four quarters, any existing damage, any special equipment like roof racks or hitches), and explains what is about to happen. For a tow, that means showing you where the tie-downs will clip, where the wheel-lift cradles will sit, what angle the load will come up at. For roadside, it means showing you the tool and explaining what you will see.`,
];

const HOW_P4 = [
  (c: Ctx) =>
    `Step 4 — Job done at the quoted rate. Receipt is emailed within minutes of completion. All major cards accepted, plus Apple Pay, Google Pay, and cash. For accident tows in ${c.city}, we bill your insurance carrier directly in most cases — you provide the policy and claim info, we handle the paperwork. For commercial or fleet accounts, the charge goes on your monthly net-30 invoice. No scrambling for a card at the curb unless that is how you prefer to pay.`,
  (c: Ctx) =>
    `Step 4 completes the job and issues payment. For ${c.svcLower} in ${c.city}, that means the driver finishes the work, walks you through the completed condition (photos again), collects payment at the quoted flat rate, and emails the receipt before leaving the scene. Payment methods: Visa, MasterCard, Amex, Discover, Apple Pay, Google Pay, cash. Fleet and commercial accounts default to net-30 invoicing with the charge logged against your account code instead of a card swipe.`,
  (c: Ctx) =>
    `Final step: payment and receipt. The rate is the flat rate dispatch quoted at the start of the call. Payment on the scene can be any major credit card, Apple Pay, Google Pay, or cash. Insurance-covered jobs in ${c.city} (accident tow, roadside under an insurance-provided plan) typically bill direct to the carrier — the driver gets the claim info from you and we handle the paperwork. Email receipt goes to you within minutes of the truck closing out the call.`,
];

const HOW_P5 = [
  (c: Ctx) =>
    `If the job changes on scene — the ${c.svcLower} call turns out to be a different problem than what you described on the phone, or the scope shifts mid-run (for example, a jump-start reveals a dead alternator and you actually need a tow instead) — we stop, tell you the new rate, and ask before we execute. Never a surprise invoice. If the new work costs more, we quote the new number. If the original roadside fee no longer applies because the job is now a tow, we credit it against the tow. Straightforward.`,
  (c: Ctx) =>
    `A word on scope changes, because they happen on ${c.svcLower} calls more than you might expect. Sometimes what sounded like ${c.svcLower} on the phone is actually a different ${c.service.category} issue once the driver looks at it. We handle that the same way: stop, re-diagnose, tell you what we see, quote the revised rate, and ask before proceeding. If a roadside fix is going to fail (bad alternator under a seemingly routine dead-battery call), we tell you now instead of taking the $85 and coming back for a second tow call in 20 minutes.`,
  (c: Ctx) =>
    `${c.city} calls sometimes evolve mid-job. We plan for it: if the original ${c.svcLower} scope changes because of what we find on scene, we pause and re-quote. Your original rate stands unless the scope materially shifts. Common examples: a tire "plug" turns out to be an unrepairable sidewall and we need to mount a spare or tow; a "jump-start" call reveals a completely dead battery that needs a replacement; a tow destination is locked or closed and we need to reroute. In every case: stop, explain, re-quote, proceed.`,
];

const WHY_HERE_P1 = [
  (c: Ctx) =>
    `Why does ${c.svcLower} happen as often as it does in ${c.city}? The short answer is density and stress. ${c.state} runs hundreds of thousands of vehicles per square mile depending on where you count, and every one of them is subject to the same hazards: cold overnight temps, hot summer heat, pothole-strewn streets, bridge and tunnel shoulders with minimal safety margin, constant construction, and an enforcement environment that punishes any vehicle that sits still too long in the wrong place.`,
  (c: Ctx) =>
    `The ${c.city} call volume for ${c.svcLower} is not accidental. ${c.state} has specific conditions that drive this exact job: narrow streets that shred sidewalls on curb scrapes, overnight residential parking that exposes batteries to cold, commercial loading zones that fill quickly and leave nowhere to diagnose a failure, and highway corridors (FDR, BQE, Cross Bronx, LIE, Belt Parkway, West Side Highway) where a breakdown becomes dangerous in seconds. Each of those conditions shows up on our dispatch log every week.`,
  (c: Ctx) =>
    `${c.city} generates more ${c.svcLower} calls per capita than suburban markets for structural reasons. Density means more opportunities for failure. On-street parking means less protection from weather. The proximity of bridges, tunnels, and expressways means breakdowns that would happen on a quiet rural road instead happen on an active parkway shoulder. And the enforcement environment — ${c.state} alternate-side parking, NYPD towing, private impound operators watching for any unattended vehicle — rewards calling a tow fast and punishes letting a problem linger.`,
];

const WHY_HERE_P2 = [
  (c: Ctx) =>
    `The single most common cause of ${c.svcLower} we see is ${c.service.commonCauses[0] ?? "the primary failure mode this service was designed to handle"}. It shows up on our dispatch log week after week across every borough, and ${c.city} is no exception. If you drive in ${c.state} long enough, you will see this pattern yourself — either on your own vehicle or a neighbor's. The difference between "annoying hour" and "ruined day" is almost always how fast help arrives and whether the operator understood the failure the first time.`,
  (c: Ctx) =>
    `Pattern number one on our ${c.svcLower} calls: ${c.service.commonCauses[0] ?? "standard failure"}. Common across all of NYC but especially visible in ${c.city} because of [density/parking/traffic specifics]. When this pattern shows up, the diagnostic is usually fast (minutes, not hours), the fix depends on whether the root cause is fixable on-site or requires a shop, and our dispatcher can usually tell which based on the phone description. That is why the phone call matters — it is half the diagnosis.`,
  (c: Ctx) =>
    `The dispatch log for ${c.svcLower} in ${c.city} skews heavily toward one cause: ${c.service.commonCauses[0] ?? "the primary failure mode"}. That is not unique to ${c.city} — it is common to every dense NYC neighborhood — but ${c.city} does see it at high volume because of local conditions. Our drivers know this pattern and start the call expecting it, while being ready to pivot if the actual diagnosis turns out to be something else.`,
];

const WHY_HERE_P3 = [
  (c: Ctx) =>
    `The second most common pattern we see on ${c.svcLower} calls is ${c.service.commonCauses[1] ?? "a secondary failure mode specific to dense urban driving"}. This one tends to concentrate in specific weather windows or in specific parts of ${c.city}. If you have been driving in NYC for more than a year, you have probably either experienced this yourself or watched a neighbor experience it. ${c.service.commonCauses[2] ?? "A third pattern"} rounds out the top three — less common than the first two but still accounting for meaningful dispatch volume.`,
  (c: Ctx) =>
    `Secondary cause, visible in roughly a third of our ${c.city} ${c.svcLower} calls: ${c.service.commonCauses[1] ?? "a related failure"}. The pattern differs from the primary cause in diagnosis and in fix, but dispatchers handle both on the same intake call. The third pattern worth naming — ${c.service.commonCauses[2] ?? "another recurring cause"} — shows up less often but matters when it does because it tends to require different equipment on scene.`,
  (c: Ctx) =>
    `Beyond the primary cause, ${c.svcLower} in ${c.city} tracks to a short list of secondary patterns: ${c.service.commonCauses[1] ?? "pattern B"}, ${c.service.commonCauses[2] ?? "pattern C"}, and ${c.service.commonCauses[3] ?? "pattern D"} in descending order. Each one implies a different on-scene procedure.

Those factors do not appear in generic "how to call a tow truck" content you would find for Ohio or Florida — they are specific to NYC and specific to ${c.state}.`,

"factor 1"} is the big one — it determines whether we can stage a truck in the travel lane, on the sidewalk, or on a nearby block. ${c.service.nycSpecifics[1] ?? "Factor 2"} affects timing. ${c.service.nycSpecifics[2] ?? "Factor 3"} affects which vehicles we can handle with which equipment. Out-of-area operators routinely trip on these.`,

    `Seasonality matters too. ${c.svcLower} calls in ${c.city} spike in certain weather windows — cold snaps for battery-related failures, summer heat for fluid and AC-related issues, winter storms for stuck-in-snow winch-outs, and rainy days for reduced-visibility accidents. Knowing the seasonal curve lets us pre-stage extra trucks in ${c.state} during peak windows so retail response times stay in the 20–40 minute zone instead of blowing out to 90+ during storms.`,
  (c: Ctx) =>
    `Time of day changes the ${c.svcLower} pattern in ${c.city}. Morning commute (6–10 AM): high volume of dead-battery and no-start calls, especially in cold months. Midday (10 AM–4 PM): steady tow volume, roadside volume, and commercial work. Evening rush (4–7 PM): tow volume up, roadside slightly down, highway-corridor calls (BQE, LIE, Belt) peak. Overnight (10 PM–6 AM): lower total volume but more emergency and safety-critical calls. We staff accordingly.`,
  (c: Ctx) =>
    `Dispatch volume for ${c.svcLower} in ${c.city} varies meaningfully by day of week. Mondays run high — accumulated weekend failures finally get addressed. Fridays run high — people rushing to finish the week, less tolerance for a vehicle that will not start. Weekends see fewer commuter calls but more "social driving" calls (Saturday night breakdowns on bar-district streets, Sunday morning post-night-out lockouts and fuel-out calls). Staffing tracks the curve.`,

Our drivers test this gear at the start of every shift, not at the moment a customer is waiting on a curb.`,

    `Mistake one on ${c.svcLower} in ${c.city}: ${(c.service.commonMistakes[0] ?? "delay").toLowerCase()}. This shows up constantly.

NYC has a persistent pattern of unlicensed operators who listen to police scanners and show up at breakdown scenes to pitch an inflated cash-only service.

If you drive a standard car with an internal combustion engine and a healthy drivetrain, wheel-lift is usually the correct answer. If anything makes it non-standard (AWD, EV, low clearance, modified suspension), the rig changes.`,
  (c: Ctx) =>
    `The typical ${c.city} ${c.svcLower} call involves a standard car — one of the sedans, coupes, or compact SUVs that dominate the city's passenger fleet. For these, wheel-lift is the default and it works. We only bump up to flatbed when the vehicle actually needs it, because flatbeds are bigger, slower to position on narrow ${c.city} streets, and cost more. Matching rig to vehicle is a dispatcher-level decision made on the intake call, based on year/make/model and any details you share.`,
  (c: Ctx) =>
    `Most cars we move on ${c.svcLower} calls in ${c.city} are standard passenger vehicles — Camrys, Civics, Accords, CR-Vs, RAV4s, the working fleet of the city. Wheel-lift rigs handle these fine and are quicker to stage on narrow blocks. The category where the rig decision gets interesting is the "non-standard" vehicles — AWD crossovers that look normal but cannot tolerate wheel-lift, EVs that physically cannot tolerate it, and luxury or low-clearance sports cars where wheel-lift would damage the front air dam.`,

Subaru, AWD crossovers from every major brand, 4WD trucks and Jeeps: all flatbed. If you are not sure whether your vehicle is AWD, tell dispatch the year/make/model and we will know. About 40% of our ${c.city} flatbed calls come from AWD vehicles where the customer did not realize the drivetrain required it.`,

    `Drivetrain matters. Most AWD crossovers in ${c.city} — Subaru Outback, Honda CR-V AWD, Toyota RAV4 AWD, every luxury German all-wheel variant, and all the 4WD trucks — cannot be safely wheel-lifted. The drive wheels have to come off the ground. Flatbed is the right answer, and dispatching the wrong rig wastes your time and ours because the driver will refuse to wheel-lift a drivetrain that cannot tolerate it. Telling dispatch the year/make/model avoids that situation.`,
